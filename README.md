# Roman Numeral Kata

Roman Numeral Kata Solution

## Background
One of the awesome things I get to do at Pivotal is pairing with engineers in the R&D function. 
Supraja was kind enough to guide and pair with me on [Roman Numerals](http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/) exercise.
We ran into several issues, some of which include:
   1. Inconsistent workstation configuration (shortcuts, mappings, et al.)
   2. Rubymine environment issues (rspecc)
   3. Following Ryan Durling's guidance *Do the simplest thing* (nebulous, I know)

I think we were finally able to get past that and get the ball rolling...
